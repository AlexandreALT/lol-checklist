# 🏆 League of Legends Win Tracker

League of Legends Win Tracker is a simple web app built with Vue.js that helps you track your progress as you aim to win at least one game with every champion in League of Legends.

💡 Motivation

This project was born from a personal challenge: winning one game with every single champion in League of Legends. To make tracking easier (and a bit more fun), I built this lightweight application where you can mark each champion as “played” once you’ve secured a win with them.
